I'm Isaac Torres. I write code for fun and profit.

Professionally, I have over 5 years of experience writing software for modeling and simulation applications, in interesting domains such as space systems, optics, and directed energy.

Outside of work I enjoy exploring the bleeding edge of C++, Computer Graphics, and learning new programming languages.

 You can find me working and playing in beautiful Albuquerque, New Mexico.
